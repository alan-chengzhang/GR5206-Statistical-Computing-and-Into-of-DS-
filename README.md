Course material for GR5206

  Please be aware that there materials can just be used for personal study. DO NOT use them for profit.
  It is the first of a serises of three elective courses in the data science track of M.A. in statistics program in Columbia University.
  In this repo, there are slides, R scripts for the slides, homeworks and labs with my personal answers and keys.

The following is an overview of the course:
  Statistical computing is an essential element of modern statistics curricula as solid programming skills and good computational understanding are necessities for current statisticians. Statisticians are routinely expected to gather data from disparate sources and implement the most current methodologies, both of which require computational fluency. This course is an introduction to the basics of statistical programming, targeted at entering statistics master students and senior undergraduate students with minimal prior programming knowledge. Examples from data science will be used throughout the course for demonstration. Students will be introduced to basic machine learning topics such as classification, regression, and clustering methods, resampling techniques including the bootstrap, cross-validation, and permutation tests, as well as the basics of optimization.

The class will be taught in the R language using the RStudio interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of the semester students will have:

  The ability to read and write code for statistical data analysis,
  
  An understanding of programming topics such as functions, object, data structures, debugging, etc.,
  
  An introduction to statistical learning methods applied to real-word data.
